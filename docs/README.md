# Overview

This module packs a bunch of clock utilities into one small package. The large arcade button makes it easy to set the tempo with the tap of your finger. An external clock input allows the module to function as a traditional clock multiplier and divider. The rate knob has two modes. In mode 1, it modifies the base clock rate allowing you to speed up or slow down the tempo of an external clock or tap tempo. In mode 2 the knob sets the clock rate directly.

# Design

Controlled by an ATMega 328 (the same chip used by the Arduino Uno) this module can easily be reporogrammed using an ISP Programmer and the Arduino IDE. One large button and one knob control all the settings, allowing you to easily dial in the tempo and switch between modes. As a purely digital module the current draw is very low, and the built in 5v regulator eliminates the need for a 5v rail on your power supply.

# Buy

I'll be updating this part soon with a link to buy PCBs on Reverb. For the time being you can email me to purchase development PCBs at a discount. These will be fully functional but have minor issues.
