# Master Clock

## Features
This module features tap tempo, 1x, 2x, 3x, 4x, 1/2x, 1/3x, and 1/4x clock multiplication/divition, and the ability to dial in the clock rate using a potentiometer. A second mode disables tap tempo and allows rate to be adjusted directly using the potentiometer.

## Files
### Master_Clock_xx.ino
This is the Arduino code. An ISP header on the board allows the microcontroller to be programmed directly.

### masterClock_xx.brd and .sch
These are the Eagle files for the PCB. To order PCBs, gerbers need to be generated using a CAM job in Eagle. A free version of Eagle is available.

### masterClockParts_xx.md
This is the parts list. A Mouser BOM is available at.

### masterClock.ai
This is the panel in Adobe Illustrator format. This can be used to manufacture a panel.
